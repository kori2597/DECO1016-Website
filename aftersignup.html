        <h2>Australia's First Online Booking Site For Hotels</h2>
        <h3>What (or wot) is Wotif?</h3>
        <p>The universe is full of questions. What is the meaning of 
            life? Where do socks go when they disappear from the dryer? 
            But the most important question right now is: What in the 
            world is Wotif?
        </p>
        <p>Well, we’re not a bird, we’re not a plane, and we’re fairly 
           certain we’re not Superman. Instead, we’re an online travel 
           company dedicated to getting you from here to there without 
           throwing your wallet to the wolves. And we’re pretty good at 
           it too! Lots of happy campers have travelled with us over the 
           last 18 years, including jetsetters... and honeymooners... 
           and road trippers... and gap year-ers...
        </p>

        <p>We have heaps of local knowledge which we use to track down 
            fantastic travel deals so you can find awesome deals every day. 
            And we’re not just talking about accommodation. With Wotif, you 
            can book everything in one place: flights, hotels, packages, and 
            activities. Talk about a time saver!
        </p>

        <p>Oh, and did we mention our Price Promise*? It covers ALL our hotels 
            and packages, so if you find a cheaper price online up to 24-hours 
            prior to check-in, we’ll match it by refunding the difference*. 
            How good is that?
        </p>

        <h3>Hotels, Flights, and Packages - Oh My!</h3>

        <p>Looking for Sydney accommodation, Melbourne accommodation or Gold 
            Coast hotels? Wotif’s got you covered. Need a hotel in Bali or some 
            spectacular Phuket accommodation? Look no further. London stays, New 
            York getaways, NZ adventures – you’ve come to the right place. 5-star 
            luxury resorts, romantic bed-and-breakfasts, funky backpacker 
            hostels... you name it, Wotif’s got it.
        </p>

        <p>But Wotif offers more than just top hotel deals (although we do have 
            stacks of ‘em). Our mantra is “Everything travel. Everyday deals. Local 
            knowledge.” That means epic flight deals, awesome activities, essential 
            travel insurance, handy car rentals, and super easy, cash-saving packages 
            every day. It means more than 2 million hotel reviews from Aussie travellers 
            like you (trust us, you don’t want to count them). And it means you can save 
            even more when you book your whole trip with us. Yep – bundle your accommodation 
            and flight together as a Wotif package and you can save on your hotel. Or book
            your flight first to unlock 10 days of special hotel deals. Either way, your 
            hotel or package is still covered by our Price Promise.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't Waste Time Searching</h3>

        <p>Searching the internet for deals on travel and spending hours comparing travel 
            sites is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Grey paint. On a really boring 
            wall. So why not save your time and cash by booking everything you need on Wotif? 
            Our online hotel booking service is awesome. So what are you waiting for? For a 
            holiday packed with value, book now with Wotif.com!
